            <p>We believe that by making learning fun and meaningful, we can help raise 
                a generation that values sustainability, understands nature, 
                and takes action to protect our planet.</p>
  
            <p>GreenLearn is a passion-driven project developed by Ashen Ellawala, Minidu Thiranjaya, Muditha Madhushan, Sanka Yashodana, and Praveen Kalansooriya â€”
