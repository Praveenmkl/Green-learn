           <p>GreenLearn is an interactive educational platform designed to inspire and educate
             children about the environment. Our mission is to plant the seeds of eco-consciousness 
             in young minds through engaging lessons, fun mini-games, and hands-on learning experiences.</p>

            <p>We believe that by making learning fun and meaningful, we can help raise 
                a generation that values sustainability, understands nature, 
                and takes action to protect our planet.</p>
  
            <p>GreenLearn is a passion-driven project developed by Ashen Ellawala, Minidu Thiranjaya, Muditha Madhushan, Sanka Yashodana, and Praveen Kalansooriya —
                 a group of dedicated students from the University of Kelaniya committed to building a 
                 greener and more informed future through engaging and interactive environmental education.</p>
